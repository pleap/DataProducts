This is a help file for the Predicting MPG application.

**Entering Data**
The application starts with default settings for the four inputs:
  * Vehicle Weight (3100 lbs)
  * Engine Displacement (160 ci)

You can change the input values by moving the sliders or checking the radio bozes.  The model automatically updates its prediction and updates the graphs.
